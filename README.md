Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
A consulting company called Artemis Financial creates unique financial strategies for its clients. They engaged us to create their open-source web application and make   it secure enough to handle the delicate financial and personal information contained therein.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I did a decent job using static testing to find the present vulnerabilities in the code base. Secure coding is crucial to preventing data theft and preserving the company's integrity and dependability reputation. 

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
By automatically finding vulnerabilities rather than having to manually examine each dependent for weaknesses, the dependency check tool was quite helpful and helped save a lot of time.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
Security experts frequently carry out vulnerability scans, penetration tests, and risk assessments to identify flaws and develop mitigation measures. These methods can be used to find system, network, or application vulnerabilities and assess the possible effects of each one. Security experts can rank vulnerabilities according to potential danger once they have been detected, and they can also decide the best mitigation method for each vulnerability. Implementing security patches, updating software, changing network configurations, or modifying security rules and procedures are some examples of mitigating measures.


How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Penetration testing and vulnerability testing to find any potential security flaws in the software application's code in order to ensure security. Utilizing tools like dependency checkers, static analysis tools, and dynamic analysis tools are examples of how to do this.


What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
